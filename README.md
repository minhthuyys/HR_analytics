I created a dashboard using Power BI. Here are some processes which I did below:
  1. Loading data in Power BI and cleaning it with Power Query
  2. Creating HR metrics like headcount, avg. leave balance, avg. salary etc. with Power Pivot
  3. Adding new columns to the data (like Employee's first name, age group etc.)
  4. Finding relationships between salary and education qualification
  5. Customizing visuals in Power BI (changing colors, axis, labels and legend)
  6. Advanced DAX calculations like cumulative headcount, leave balance more than 20 days

This dashboard answers questions such as:
  1. How many people are in each job?
  2. Gender break-down of the staff
  3. Age spread of the staff
  4. Qualification vs. Salary
  5. Staff growth trend over time
